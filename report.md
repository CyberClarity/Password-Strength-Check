# 📄 Task 6 Report: Password Strength Evaluation

## 🔍 Overview
As part of my cybersecurity internship, I created a Python password strength checker tool. I tested multiple passwords with varying complexity using my tool and online password strength checkers. I researched password attacks and learned about best practices for creating secure passwords.

## 🛠 Password Testing Summary
I tested the following example passwords:
- `password123` → 🔴 Weak
- `Pass123!` → 🟡 Moderate
- `Str0ngP@ssw0rd2024!` → 🟢 Strong
- `Th!sIsAVeryL0ng&ComplexP@ssw0rd` → 🔒 Very Strong

**Observations:**
- Longer passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols scored highest.
- Simple or common passwords were weak and easy to guess.

## 📌 Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
✅ Use at least 12 characters (longer is better).  
✅ Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.  
✅ Avoid dictionary words, personal information, or patterns (e.g., `123456`).  
✅ Use passphrases made of random words or sentences.  
✅ Use a password manager to store and generate unique passwords.  
✅ Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

## 🔐 Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all possible combinations until the password is cracked.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Tries words from a dictionary or common passwords list.
- **Phishing**: Tricks users into revealing passwords through fake websites or emails.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Reuses stolen passwords from one breach to access other accounts.

## ✅ Conclusion
This task helped me understand how password complexity affects security. I learned that length and diversity of characters greatly enhance password strength and that combining this with MFA and good password management practices provides the best protection.
