# Task 6: Password Strength Checker

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script that evaluates the strength of passwords as part of my cybersecurity internship Task 6. The script checks password complexity based on length, character types, and gives feedback to help improve password security.

## Files
- `password_checker.py` — Python script to analyze password strength.
- `report.md` — Summary of findings.
  
## What I Did
- Built a custom password checker in Python.
- Tested multiple passwords of varying complexity.
- Compared results with online password strength tools.
- Learned about password attacks (brute force, dictionary) and best practices.

## How to Run
```bash
python3 password_checker.py
```
